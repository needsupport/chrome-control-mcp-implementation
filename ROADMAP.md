## Chrome Control MCP - Project Roadmap

### Project Vision

The Chrome Control MCP (Model Context Protocol) server aims to revolutionize how AI assistants interact with web pages. Current approaches rely heavily on screenshots for web interaction, which is inefficient in terms of bandwidth, processing power, and semantic understanding. Instead, we will build a system that directly analyzes the DOM (Document Object Model) to provide AI assistants with a rich, semantic understanding of web pages without relying on screenshots.

### Core Principles

1. **Modular Architecture**: Build small, focused components that each handle a single responsibility
2. **Semantic Understanding**: Prioritize deep understanding of web page structure and content
3. **Efficient Communication**: Minimize data transfer between AI assistants and web pages
4. **Robust Interaction**: Enable reliable identification and interaction with web elements
5. **Developer Experience**: Create well-documented, easy-to-extend components
6. **Reliability**: Ensure robustness with proper error handling and recovery strategies
7. **Local Performance**: Optimize for local deployment and execution

### Component Architecture

Our system is composed of these key components, each implemented as small, focused modules:

1. **Chrome MCP Server**
   - Handles incoming requests from AI assistants
   - Routes commands to appropriate components
   - Returns structured semantic responses

2. **Chrome API Wrapper**
   - Provides a clean interface to Chrome DevTools Protocol
   - Manages browser sessions and tabs
   - Handles basic navigation and DOM access
   - Implements connection retry logic and error recovery

3. **Chrome Process Manager**
   - Launches and monitors Chrome instances
   - Handles Chrome crashes and restarts
   - Ensures proper debug port configuration
   - Manages cleanup on shutdown

4. **DOM Interaction Layer**
   - Executes actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling
   - Provides reliable element selection strategies
   - Manages element state (visibility, enabled status)

5. **Semantic Analyzer**
   - Builds semantic representation of pages
   - Identifies content types (articles, forms, navigation)
   - Creates relationship maps between elements

6. **Content Extractor**
   - Extracts structured content from pages
   - Provides text, metadata, and simplified representation
   - Filters irrelevant content

7. **Navigation Manager**
   - Handles complex navigation scenarios
   - Waits for page loads and state changes
   - Detects and manages redirects

8. **Form Handler**
   - Identifies and interacts with forms
   - Fills in fields with appropriate data types
   - Handles form submission and validation

9. **Error Handler**
   - Provides consistent error reporting
   - Implements recovery strategies
   - Maintains detailed error logs
   - Handles connection failures and retries

10. **Cache System**
    - Optimizes performance through intelligent caching
    - Manages cache invalidation
    - Reduces redundant operations

11. **Logging System**
    - Records detailed operation logs
    - Supports debugging and performance analysis
    - Implements log rotation and storage management

12. **Resource Manager**
    - Tracks and manages system resources
    - Implements proper cleanup on shutdown
    - Prevents memory leaks and resource exhaustion

**Phase 5: Local Performance Optimization (Weeks 1-2)**
- Optimize for local execution environment
- Implement performance profiling
- Add caching for frequently accessed content
- Reduce overhead in local communication

**Phase 6: Reliability & Error Handling (Weeks 3-4)**
- Add robust error handling for common local issues
- Implement logging for easier local debugging

### Performance & Reliability Targets

1. **Speed**: Process page semantics in under 500ms for typical web pages
2. **Resource Usage**: Use 75% less bandwidth compared to screenshot-based approaches
3. **Accuracy**: Achieve >95% accuracy in element identification and interaction
4. **Reliability**: Successfully handle navigation and interaction for >90% of top websites
5. **Robustness**: Recover from 99% of common failure scenarios automatically
6. **Local Performance**: Minimize CPU and memory usage for local deployment

### Technical Approaches

1. **DOM Analysis**: Use efficient traversal algorithms to build semantic models
2. **Multiple Selection Strategies**: Implement CSS selectors, XPath, and semantic reference methods
3. **Event Handling**: Use both JavaScript execution and CDP events for robust interaction
4. **Intelligent Caching**: Cache DOM structures with smart invalidation on page changes
5. **Error Recovery**: Implement multiple fallback strategies for element interaction
6. **Process Management**: Robust Chrome process handling with monitoring and auto-recovery
7. **Local Optimization**: Minimize IPC overhead and optimize for local execution

### Current Focus: Chrome Process Management

We are currently focusing on completing the Chrome Process Manager implementation:

1. **Robust Process Handling**: Complete launching and monitoring Chrome instances
2. **Crash Recovery**: Implement automatic restart with exponential backoff
3. **Resource Cleanup**: Ensure proper cleanup of temporary directories and processes
4. **Event System**: Add events for process lifecycle (start, stop, crash, restart)
5. **Health Monitoring**: Add checks for Chrome process responsiveness

By completing these improvements, we'll create a reliable foundation for the Chrome Control MCP system that enables AI assistants to understand and interact with web pages in a more efficient and effective manner than current screenshot-based approaches, with a focus on local deployment and performance.
